# Wood Sorting System - TestIR & Master Controller

## Overview

This directory contains the test implementation of the automated wood sorting system, featuring real-time IR beam trigger detection and AI-powered defect analysis. The system consists of two main components:

- **Master Controller** (Arduino): Handles IR beam sensing, conveyor control, and servo gate actuation
- **TestIR Application** (Python): Provides the GUI interface, AI defect detection, and grading logic

## System Architecture

```
IR Beam Sensor → Arduino Master Controller → Python Application → Servo Gates

  Detects wood      Triggers detection      Analyzes defects   Sorts by grade
  presence/clearance   and controls motor     with AI model     (G2-0 to G2-4)
```

## Master Controller (Arduino)

### Hardware Requirements
- Arduino Uno R3 or compatible board
- IR beam sensor (connected to pin 11)
- 4 servo motors (connected to pins 2, 3, 4, 5)
- Stepper motor driver (connected to pins 8, 9, 10)
- Stepper motor for conveyor belt

### Pin Configuration
```cpp
const int IR_SENSOR_PIN = 11;      // IR beam sensor input
const int SERVO_1_PIN = 2;         // Gate 1 servo (G2-0)
const int SERVO_2_PIN = 3;         // Gate 2 servo (G2-1/2/3)
const int SERVO_3_PIN = 4;         // Gate 3 servo (G2-4)
const int SERVO_4_PIN = 5;         // Additional servo
const int STEPPER_ENA_PIN = 8;     // Stepper motor enable
const int STEPPER_DIR_PIN = 9;     // Stepper motor direction
const int STEPPER_STEP_PIN = 10;   // Stepper motor step
```

### Serial Commands

#### Commands Sent TO Python:
- `'B'`: IR beam broken (wood piece detected)
- `'L:[ms]'`: IR beam cleared with duration in milliseconds

#### Commands Received FROM Python:
- `'1'`: Move servos to 90° (Gate 1 - G2-0 Perfect)
- `'2'`: Move servos to 45° (Gate 2 - G2-1/2/3 Good/Fair/Poor)
- `'3'`: Move servos to 135° (Gate 3 - G2-4 Reject)
- `'C'`: Set CONTINUOUS mode (motor always on)
- `'T'`: Set TRIGGER mode (motor controlled by IR beam)
- `'X'`: Set IDLE mode (motor off)

### Operating Modes

1. **IDLE Mode**: System disabled, motor stopped
2. **CONTINUOUS Mode**: Motor runs continuously, detection always active
3. **TRIGGER Mode**: Motor runs continuously, detection triggered by IR beam

### Installation
1. Open `master_controller.ino` in Arduino IDE
2. Connect Arduino board
3. Upload the sketch
4. Note the serial port (e.g., `/dev/ttyACM0` or `COM3`)

### Software Dependencies
```
tkinter              # GUI framework

numpy                # Numerical operations
```

### Installation

1. **Install Python dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r ../requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Configure Arduino connection:**
   - Update the serial port in the application if needed
   - The app auto-detects common Arduino ports

3. **Set up AI model:**
   - Ensure Hailo AI model is available at the specified path
   - Model: `V2DefectCombined--640x640_quant_hailort_hailo8_1`

### Configuration

#### Camera Settings
- **Resolution**: 1280x720
- **Frame Rate**: 30 FPS
- **Top Camera Distance**: 37cm
- **Bottom Camera Distance**: 29cm
- **Autofocus**: Automatically disabled on connection for consistent focus
- **Bottom Camera**: Frame mirrored horizontally for consistent perspective

#### Grading Parameters
- **Wood Width**: Measured dynamically from detected wood (typically 100-150mm)
- **Pixel-to-mm Factors**:
  - Top Camera: 2.96 pixels/mm
  - Bottom Camera: 3.18 pixels/mm

#### Grading Standards (SS-EN 161-1-1)
```
Limit = (0.10 × measured_wood_width) + constant

Where measured_wood_width is dynamically calculated from detected wood.

Example for 115mm wood:
Sound Knots:    G2-0: ≤21.5mm, G2-1: ≤31.5mm, G2-2: ≤46.5mm, G2-3: ≤61.5mm
Dead Knots:     G2-0: ≤11.5mm, G2-1: ≤21.5mm, G2-2: ≤31.5mm, G2-3: ≤61.5mm
Unsound Knots:  G2-2: ≤25.5mm, G2-3: ≤50.5mm
```

### Usage

#### Starting the Application
```bash
cd /path/to/testIR
python testIR.py
```

#### Operating Modes

1. **IDLE Mode**: System disabled, no operations
2. **TRIGGER Mode**: Waits for IR beam trigger, processes one piece at a time
3. **CONTINUOUS Mode**: Continuous detection and grading

#### GUI Controls

- **System Status**: Shows current mode and detection state
- **Camera Feeds**: Live video from top and bottom cameras
- **Detection Settings**:
  - Top ROI: Enable/disable region of interest for top camera
  - Live Detect: Toggle real-time detection
  - Auto Grade: Enable automatic grading
- **Statistics Tabs**:
  - Grade Summary: Live counts by grade
  - Defect Details: Detailed defect analysis
  - Performance: Processing metrics
  - Recent Activity: Processing log

#### IR Beam Trigger Sequence (TRIGGER Mode)

1. **Beam Cleared**: System waits for wood piece
2. **Beam Broken ('B')**: Detection starts, servo resets to 90°
3. **Detection Active**: AI analyzes defects in real-time
4. **Beam Clears ('L')**: Grading completes, servo moves to appropriate gate

### Grading Logic

#### Wood Detection
- Synchronized detection: Bottom camera only processes if top camera detects wood
- Dynamic ROI generation based on detected wood boundaries
- Color-based wood detection with morphological filtering

#### Individual Defect Grading
Each defect is graded using the formula: `Limit = (0.10 × wood_width) + constant`

#### Surface Grade Determination
1. **Size-based grading**: Worst individual defect grade
2. **Count-based grading**: Dead/Unsound knot limits per meter
3. **Final grade**: Worst of size and count criteria

#### Gate Mapping
- **G2-0** → Gate 1 (90°)
- **G2-1/2/3** → Gate 2 (45°)
- **G2-4** → Gate 3 (135°)

### Troubleshooting

#### Arduino Connection Issues
- Check serial port permissions: `sudo chmod 666 /dev/ttyACM0`
- Verify Arduino is properly connected and powered
- Check baud rate (9600) matches between Arduino and Python

#### Camera Issues
- Ensure cameras are connected and not used by other applications
- Check camera device paths using `v4l2-ctl --list-devices`
- Verify camera resolutions are supported
- Cameras automatically reconnect on disconnection with retry logic
- Autofocus is disabled automatically on connection
- Bottom camera frames are mirrored for consistent perspective

#### AI Model Issues
- Ensure Hailo driver is installed and running
- Check model path exists and is accessible
- Verify model file integrity

#### IR Beam Problems
- Adjust IR sensor sensitivity if needed
- Check debounce delay (currently 100ms)
- Verify stable power supply to IR sensor

### Testing
